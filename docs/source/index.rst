Welcome to PythonForWindows's documentation!
============================================

Description
"""""""""""

PythonForWindows is a base of code aimed to make interaction with ``Windows`` (on X86/X64) easier (for both 32 and 64 bits Python).
Its goal is to offer abstractions around some of the OS features in a (I hope) pythonic way.
It also tries to make the barrier between python and native execution thinner in both ways.
There is no external dependencies but it relies heavily on the ``ctypes`` module.


Some of this code is clean (IMHO) and some parts are just a wreck that works for now.
Let's say that the codebase evolves with my needs and my curiosity.

If you have any issue, question, suggestion do not hesitate to contact me.
I am always glad to have feedbacks from people using this project.

Examples are available on the `github page <https://github.com/hakril/pythonforwindows#pythonforwindows>`_  and in the :ref:`sample_of_code`.
